# Project1
Pokedex project

This first class project will utilize APIs to build a "pokedex" that users can use to search for pokemon by name and type, and build their team of 6 within the page.

MVP features will be a search input, that can take the input, and search by either name or pokemon type. It will display a scroll list on the left hand side and the pokemon description on the right, with the ability to add to a party of 6 (will display sprites on the top).

This will be done using HTML, CSS, JS and Jquery, and AJAX to call the API.
